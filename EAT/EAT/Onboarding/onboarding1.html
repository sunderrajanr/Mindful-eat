    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Many people overeat, diet a lot (restrict what they eat), or just feel badly about their eating.</li>
        <li>This app can help you feel better about the way you eat and manage your weight.</li>
        <li>Food-based diets don’t work for most people. You feel deprived or get tired of the diet foods and can’t stick with it.</li>
        <li>Appetite-monitoring is DIFFERENT. You eat what you want and limit amounts.</li>
    </ul>
